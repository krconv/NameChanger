# NameChanger
A Minecraft Bukkit plugin which allows a user to change his or her name in game on the fly.

This plugin no longer works with the latest version of Bukkit. At one point in time, this plugin allowed a user to either change their name during game play, or to set the plugin to automatically change names on login.
