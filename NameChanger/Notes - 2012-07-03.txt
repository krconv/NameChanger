NEW CLASSES:

AutoAltManager - This is what the plugin will use to run automatic alts. This is the class you will use.
AutoAltDataAccess - This is never to be used direcly, it is only to be used by AutoAltManager.



NEW FUNCTIONALITY:

NameChanger.isValidUserName(String toTest)
 - Ensures user name contains only valid characters and between 2-16 characters long

AutoAltManager.doesPlayerHaveAlt(String PlayerName)

AutoAltManager.setAltNameForPlayer(String PlayerName, String AltName)
 - Stores new alt name for a player name
 - Confirms valid PlayerName and AltName before saving (should already be validated, just making sure)

AutoAltManager.removeAltNameForPlayer(String PlayerName)

NOTES:

When taking in a player name or alt name:
 - Trim leading/trailing spaces by doing name = String.Trim(name);
 - Check name using isValidUserName(String toTest) - added this to confirm correct length and characters

Before calling setAltNameForPlayer(), first make sure that getPlayerNameForAlt(AltName)==null
(Do not want alt to be listed for more than one player at once)
